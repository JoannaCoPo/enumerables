# Ruby Enumerables Practice!
## "We gon' 'numerabble now!"

### Does iteration make your skin crawl? Do you need practice with a certain enumerable?

### Well c'mon down and face your fears! Write tests for your fellow students. Learn in the process!

### Synopsis: Pass these tests and practice enumerables. Progress in your knowledge. Make your own tests with other enumerables. Progress in your knowledge. Make commits to this project. Progress in your knowledge. Others clone and learn from your tests. They make their own tests and make commits AD NAUSEA! I'M GETTING SICK!

### Why do this? The best way to learn is to teach and while you're learning you can contribute to a better world by helping others to learn and to be empowered to learn a new skill. What a great thing thing to be a part of.

### This is an open source project.

### I've started with practicing find_all enumerable. I'll continue adding to this, or maybe I won't. No promises. Only a start and hope that maybe this will help someone.

### Cheers!
